# StemEd.io
Stem ED is a Web 3.0 platform for STEMed.io (coming soon) STEM is a rostering and NFT Creation platform for educators, Schools, and Districts to use in creating and tracking the progress of students through curriculum and the provide an alternative space to Zoom that will be accessible to users for teaching class and track student progress.  
The function will include many features that progress through many speculative phases to be successful with web 3.0. This is a working timeline that may change. 
1. Use web 3.0 wallet(s) to connect to YetiAcademy so NFT holders can access 1 school account 30 students, 1 PD (professional Development) license and/or 10 TA Home accounts. 
2. Launch an NFT Sale for STEMed access tokens for the above.  This will allow access to web 2.0 YetiAcademy and or TA Home to raise funds to complete the development of the following phases with the existing dev team and to expand the development team, web 3 marketing team, run discord server for promotion and support of web 3 users and to build out a true web 3.0 interface. This will be the start of a STEMed DAO. 
3. Connect Users to Web 3.0 wallets TBD on tech and platform so that students can have NFT's created and saved for them. 
4. Rostering users with Google classroom and Classlink using the One Roster standard into Web 3 wallets that allow them access to Web 3 content.
5. Provide a learning environment that simulates the in-person classroom in the Metaverse using Sandbox and Decentraland Land plots. 
6. Provide Content from Yeti Academy on Web 3.0 content functionality.
